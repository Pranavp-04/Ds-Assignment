    "#These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) because they are reserved for specific purposes within the language.\n",
    "#Here are five important Python keywords along with their significance and examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1 if: The if keyword is used to define conditional statements in Python. It is followed by a condition, and if the condition evaluates to True, the code block under the if statement is executed\n",
    "x = 10\n",

    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "    \n",

    "    #2 for: The for keyword is used to create loops in Python. It is often used to iterate over elements in a sequence (such as lists, tuples, or strings) or to execute a block of code a certain number of times.\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    \n",

    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "    \n",

    "#1.Allowed Characters: Identifiers can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2.Case Sensitivity: Python identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, myVar, MyVar, and MYVAR are all considered different identifiers.\n",

    "#These are special words that Python has reserved for specific purposes and cannot be used as identifiers.\n",

    "#4.Length: There is no limit on the length of identifiers, but it's good practice to keep them concise and meaningful.\n",

    "#1 Explanation: Comments can explain the purpose of code, clarify complex algorithms, or provide context for specific operations.\n",
    "#2 Documentation: Comments serve as documentation for the codebase, helping other developers understand how different parts of the code work.\n",
    "#3 Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable lines of code for debugging purposes without deleting them.\n",
    "#4 TODOs and FIXMEs: Comments can highlight areas of code that need attention or improvement, such as unfinished functionality (TODO) or known issues (FIXME).\n",

    "#5 What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python?\n",
    "#If indentation is incorrect in Python, it can lead to several issues:\n",

    "\n",
    "#2 Logic Errors: Incorrect indentation can change the logic of the code, leading to unexpected behavior or logical errors.\n",
    "#For example, changing the indentation of statements within a loop or conditional statement can alter the control flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 Unintended Nesting: Incorrect indentation can cause unintended nesting of code blocks. This can lead to confusion and make the code difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4 Readability Issues: Improper indentation can reduce the readability of the code, making it harder to understand and maintain for both the original developer and other team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4 Debugging Challenges: Incorrect indentation can make it more challenging to debug the code. Developers may spend more time trying to identify and fix indentation errors, especially in larger codebases.\n",
